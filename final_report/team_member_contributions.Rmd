# Contributions to the Data Project

## Kaylhan Garcia

I created the github, organized our files to stay tidy, did the Seattle and MPD exploratory data analysis, and the presentation (I created the slides, added necessary information that I have conducted).

Here is the GitHub link so you can see each member's contribution throughout the semester on this project: <https://github.com/kerawyd/data-412-mpd-use-of-force>
